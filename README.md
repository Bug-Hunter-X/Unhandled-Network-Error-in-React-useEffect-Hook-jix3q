# Unhandled Network Error in React useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications where network errors are not properly handled within a useEffect hook. The component fetches data from an API endpoint, and while it attempts to catch errors, it does not correctly update the loading state. This can result in a loading indicator that remains indefinitely even after an error occurs.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains the buggy component code. The `try...catch` block is correctly handling potential errors during the fetch, but the `finally` block, which is responsible for setting the `loading` state to `false`, is incomplete or missing. This omission prevents the component from updating its UI after an error occurs or after the request completes successfully.  The loading indicator will stay active, creating a poor user experience.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the component. The solution includes an error handling mechanism that updates the loading state in the `finally` block regardless of success or failure in the API call. This ensures that the loading indicator correctly reflects the application's state, leading to improved UX.
